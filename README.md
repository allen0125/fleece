This project is a fork of [Ollama](https://github.com/hinterdupfinger/obsidian-ollama). Given the original project's inactivity and my vision for new features, I've created this fork while maintaining compliance with the original project's open source license.

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows you to use [Ollama](https://ollama.ai), (TODO)[GPT](https://platform.openai.com/), (TODO)[Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/), and more AI models within your notes.

This requires a local installation of [Ollama](https://ollama.ai).
